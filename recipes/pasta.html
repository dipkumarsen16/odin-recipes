    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta is a staple food of Italian origin made from wheat flour and water, sometimes enriched with eggs. It comes
        in countless shapes—like spaghetti, penne, or ravioli—each designed to pair with different sauces or cooking
        styles. Pasta can be served fresh or dried, boiled or baked, and is celebrated for its versatility in dishes
        ranging from simple olive oil tosses to rich, layered lasagnas.</p>
    <p>Beyond being a meal, pasta carries cultural weight as a symbol of Italian cuisine and hospitality. With a history
        dating back to ancient times, it has become a global comfort food enjoyed in homes and restaurants alike. Its
        adaptability makes it a canvas for creativity, whether in traditional recipes or modern fusion dishes.</p>
